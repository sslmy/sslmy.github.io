<p>The development of humanoid robots is supported by extensive research across various fields, aiming to replicate human motion and interaction capabilities. They have been widely applied in multiple domains including industrial production, medical assistance, and complex rescue missions. In industrial automation, humanoid robots can perform precise operations or high-risk tasks to reduce safety risks for human workers. In the medical field, they offer precise and repeatable movements for surgical assistance and rehabilitation training to support patient recovery. Moreover, humanoid robots have demonstrated significant potential in disaster response and search-and-rescue missions, being able to access areas that are difficult or impossible for humans to enter. Looking ahead, with ongoing technological advancements, humanoid robots are expected to play increasingly important roles in sectors such as service industries and household tasks, potentially becoming common faces in fields like healthcare, education, and customer service, thereby greatly transforming human lifestyles and work patterns. </p>
